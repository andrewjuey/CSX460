## Tuning Parameter

Generically and regardless of model type, what are the purposes of a model
tuning parameters?


```

The purpose of a model's tuning parameter(s) is that it/they ensures that a model is optimized. The model tuning parameters optimize the parameters which affect the model so that the algorithm can perform at its best. One common way the model tuning parameter optimizes the model is by ensuring the model is neither overfitted nor underfitted to the data available, which in turn affects the tradeoff between variance and bias. 

```

## Caret Models

This assignment demonstrates the use of caret for constructing models. Each
model should be built and compared using using `Kappa` as the performance
metric calculated using 10-fold repeated cross-validation with 3 folds.

Using the rectangular data that you created for the NYCFlights to create a model
for arr_delay >= 15 minutes.

- glm
- rpart
- knn
- C50
- randomForest
- adaBoost
- Two methods of your choice from the Caret Model List (you will need to install any dependencies)

Save the caret objects with the names provided.
